    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <p>Here is what you need to get going!</p>
     <ul>
        <li>2 steaks (your preferred cut, such as ribeye or sirloin)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup breadcrumbs (preferably panko)</li>
        <li>1 cup breadcrumbs (preferably panko)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
     </ul>
     <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
        <li>Take the steaks out of the refrigerator and let them sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes. This helps ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li>Heat a cast-iron skillet or oven-safe pan over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil to the pan and let it get hot.</li>
        <li>Season the steaks generously with salt and black pepper on both sides.</li>
        <li>Place the steaks in the hot skillet and sear them for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until you achieve a nice brown crust. This will depend on the thickness of your steaks and your desired level of doneness.</li>
        <li>While the steaks are searing, prepare the garlic crumb mixture. In a bowl, combine the minced garlic, breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, and chopped parsley. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Remove the seared steaks from the skillet and place them on a cutting board or a plate. Let them rest for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, add the garlic crumb mixture to the skillet and stir it around for a minute or two until the breadcrumbs become golden and crispy. Be careful not to burn them</li>
        <li>Place the seared steaks back into the skillet on top of the garlic crumb mixture. Press the mixture onto the top of each steak to create a crust.</li>
        <li>Transfer the skillet with the steaks into the preheated oven and cook for about 5-7 minutes for medium-rare, or adjust the cooking time to your preferred level of doneness.</li>
        <li>Once the steaks are done, remove them from the oven and let them rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat.</li>
        <li>Slice the steaks against the grain and serve them with the crispy garlic crumb topping. You can garnish with additional chopped parsley if desired.</li>
     </ol>
